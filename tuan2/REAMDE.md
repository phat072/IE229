# Company Sales Data Analysis

This project is about analyzing a company's sales data using Python and Matplotlib. The data is stored in a CSV file named `company_sales.csv`.

## Data

The `company_sales.csv` file contains sales data for a company. Each row in the file represents a month, and each column represents a different product. The columns in the file are:

- `month_number`: The month number (from 1 to 12).
- `facecream`: The number of face cream units sold.
- `facewash`: The number of face wash units sold.
- `toothpaste`: The number of toothpaste units sold.
- `bathingsoap`: The number of bathing soap units sold.
- `shampoo`: The number of shampoo units sold.
- `moisturizer`: The number of moisturizer units sold.
- `total_units`: The total number of units sold.
- `total_profit`: The total profit from all sales.

## Preliminary Code

The preliminary code in the `BT_lamthem.ipynb` file is written in Python and uses libraries such as pandas and matplotlib to analyze and visualize sales data. Here's a brief explanation of the preliminary code:

1. **Importing necessary libraries**: The code starts by importing pandas and matplotlib, which are essential libraries for data analysis and visualization in Python.

2. **Loading the data**: The pandas function `read_csv` is used to load the data from the `company_sales.csv` file into a DataFrame.

3. **Exploring the data**: The `info` and `describe` methods are used to get a quick overview of the data.

4. **Visualizing the data**: The code uses matplotlib to create various types of plots such as line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, histograms, pie charts, and stacked area charts.
