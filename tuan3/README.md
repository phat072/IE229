## Testing the Model

The selected code is used to test the performance of the trained neural network model on the test dataset.

```python
correct = 0
total = len(test_loader.dataset)
for images, labels in test_loader:
  images = images.view(-1, 28*28)
  y = neural_network_model(images)
  pred_labels = y.max(dim=1)[1]
  correct = correct + (pred_labels == labels).sum()

print("correct: ",correct.item())
print("total: ",total)
print("accuracy: ",correct.item()/total)
```

Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

1. **Initialize counters**: The `correct` counter is used to keep track of the number of correctly classified images, and `total` is the total number of images in the test dataset.

2. **Iterate over the test dataset**: For each batch of images and labels in the test dataset, the images are reshaped to match the input shape expected by the model.

3. **Model inference**: The model's forward pass is run on the images to get the predicted outputs `y`. The `max(dim=1)[1]` operation is used to get the indices of the maximum values along dimension 1 (the class probabilities), which represent the model's predicted labels.

4. **Count correct predictions**: The predicted labels are compared to the true labels, and the sum of the correct predictions is added to the `correct` counter.

5. **Print results**: The number of correct predictions, the total number of images, and the accuracy (the ratio of correct predictions to the total number of images) are printed out.
